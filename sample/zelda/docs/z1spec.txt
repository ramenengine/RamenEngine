  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  Where to get this document

  The latest version of this document is always posted at
  http://tril.tunes.org/games/z1spec/



  1.2.  Disclaimer

  The information in this document is not guaranteed to be correct.  I
  take no responsibility for the integrity of your Zelda rom file if you
  mess it up.  Please use patch files (such as the standard patch format
  being adopted by several emulator authors) instead of modifying rom
  images directly, so you don't lose the original game or ruin it for
  somebody else.


  1.3.  Before Reading This Document

  Before reading this document, you are expected to know what a pattern
  table is.  If you don't, read a document devoted to NES technical
  information first.


  1.4.  Numeric Conventions

  All numbers are in decimal, unless written with a dollar sign ($), for
  convenience by those who aren't used to hex.


  1.5.  IMPORTANT Note about Offsets

  Offsets are all from the start of PRG ROM, not from the start of
  ZELDA.NES!  To calculate offsets into ZELDA.NES, add 16 bytes (the
  size of the .NES header) to every offset in this document.


  1.6.  About this Document

  I am releasing this document into the public domain.  However, if you
  find it useful, or if you have any comments, don't hesitate to send me
  an e-mail.

  I created this document so that my friend Conrad could create a map
  editor.  However, I also enjoy reading 6502 assembly code and solving
  tough problems.  I intend to eventually account for every byte in the
  Zelda ROM, but I am putting off work on that for a while now that this
  spec is basically done.  It should be enough to create a decent map
  editor, if it is correct.  If it is not correct, let me know and we
  can try to fix it.  I hope you get as much fun out of using this
  document as I had making it.  Keep hacking!


  1.7.  The Art of ROM Hacking

  When I did a (pretty intensive) search for "zelda hack" in my usual
  search for duplicate projects before beginning something new, I came
  up with a lot of sprite modifications (clearly made using various NES
  pattern editors that are readily available), and a page with a few
  offsets that were apparently guessed at random.  This is a sad and
  pathetic state.  Why doesn't anyone do things the right way?  The ONLY
  way to get accurate information about modifying a game is to dig in
  and immerse yourself in its machine code.  I hope this document, when
  released, will show people what is really possible and encourage them
  to repeat what I have done, for other games.  Only afterwards can you
  call yourself a ROM hacker.  Using a program someone else has written
  doesn't count (this goes for all the script kiddies, too)!  However,
  getting the information for this document was a lot of work.  Don't
  get frustrated right away, and you will find some very interesting
  things in the depths of code, and perhaps even a new perspective on
  programming- from the outside.

  2.2.  The Overworld Map

  The overworld is 16 screens wide by 8 screens high.  Screens are
  numbered 0..127 starting at the upper left corner, moving left to
  right, then top to bottom.  Therefore the screen number is calculated
  by 16*R + C where R is the map row and C is the map column.

  However, not all 128 overworld locations are entirely different.  Some
  have the same graphic as another location.  Each unique screen is
  stored once.  Screens that have the same picture, but different
  colors, can still share the same memory for their graphic (the colors
  are stored elsewhere).

  The overworld screen table stores 124 unique screens of 16 bytes each
  (see the next section for a description for individual screens).
  These in no particular order.  The overworld map contains 128 bytes,
  one for each 2-D map location.  Each byte in the overworld map refers
  to one screen in the overworld screen table.


  2.3.  Overworld Screens

  One screen in the overworld is 16 columns wide.  Each column is 11
  squares high.  Each screen takes 16 bytes, one byte for each column of
  squares on that screen.

  Before we learn how to find the data for a column, we need to discuss
  the format of the data for a column.


  2.4.  Columns



  2.4.1.  Column Data Format

  The data for column is 11 bytes, one byte for each square in the
  column, stored in order from top to bottom.  A square is made of 4
  tiles arranged in a 2x2 square on the screen.

  It takes 11 bytes to draw a column, but these aren't always stored as
  11 consecutive bytes in memory.  Instead, if two squares (one above
  the other) are the same graphic (use the same tiles), they can be
  stored in one byte instead of two.  The number of bytes it takes to
  store a column depends on how many squares are stored doubly.  The
  minimum number is 6 bytes (if there are 5 duplicated squares and one
  left over), and the maximum is 11 (if no squares are duplicated).
  There is no way to duplicate more than 2 squares at a time, so even if
  all the squares in a column are the same, you still need 6 bytes to
  store that column.

  There are 64 possible squares (although not all of the 64 possible may
  be actually used).  This means that only 6 bits are needed to store
  the square number.  Since each square uses one byte, there are 2 extra
  bits in the byte for each square.  The meaning of a square byte is
  described in section 4, "Squares."

  The 6 bits for the square number are stored in bits 0-5 of each byte
  in the column data.  If bit 6 is set, this square is a duplicated
  square and will take up two rows, one above the other, in this column.


  2.4.2.  Column Tables

  The column data for 16 different columns is stored together in what we
  will call a "column table."  A column table contains the 6-11 bytes
  for each of the 16 columns in that column table, stored all in one
  contiguous area of memory (which, if you do the arithmetic, could be
  as small as 96 bytes, or as large as 176 bytes, depending on how many
  total squares are doubled in the columns inside the column table).

  The first byte of the 6-11 bytes for an individual column always has
  bit 7 set.  This is how to locate columns within a column table.  We
  have now accounted for all 8 bits of every byte inside the column
  data.


  2.4.3.  The Column Directory

  There are 16 column tables, for a total of 256 different columns in
  the overworld.  The addresses of the beginning of each column table
  are stored in a table of column tables, which we will call the "column
  directory." I have copied these addresses and converted them to
  offsets in the ROM in the above table in the rows "Column Table XX",
  for your convenience.

  (The naming for this two-tiered table structure is taken from Intel's
  description of its tiered structure for addressing memory pages in the
  386 processor's virtual memory model.  This model uses a "page
  directory" which contains pointers to "page tables", which in turn
  point at individual pages, which are 4K blocks of memory that are the
  unit of memory allocation.)


  2.4.4.  Indexing a Column

  Now we can understand the meaning of the 16 bytes in each overworld
  screen.  There are 256 columns, so each column byte in an overworld
  screen refers to one column.  The high nibble of the byte selects
  which column table to use from the column directory.  The low nibble
  selects a column from that column table.


  2.5.  Squares

  2.5.1.  The Primary Square Table

  The primary square table is an array of 64 (or 56?) bytes, one for
  each square number used in the column data.  The values in the primary
  square table are used to determine the tiles to draw for a particular
  square number.  If the value is greater than or equal to 16 (hex $10),
  then it refers to the first of four consecutive tiles in NES Pattern
  Table 1 (Pattern Table 0 is not used for map background tiles).  The 4
  chosen tiles are the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower
  right tiles for that square, in that order.  If the value in the
  primary square table is less than 16, the four tiles in this square
  are taken from the secondary square table (using the value that is
  less than 16 as the index).


  2.5.2.  The Secondary Square Table

  The secondary square table contains tile numbers for squares in the
  overworld that have one or more tiles repeated.  To save space in the
  pattern tables, pattern tables only store tiles for squares for which
  all the tiles are unique.

  Each entry in the secondary square table is 4 bytes long, and there
  are 16 entries (indexed by values in the primary square table that are
  less than 16).  The bytes specify the tile numbers (again in Pattern
  Table 1) for a square in the same order used by the primary square
  table.


  2.6.  Secrets

  Secret squares are marked by a special value in the primary square
  table.  When the map is drawn, the primary square table value for a
  secret is translated into the value for the graphic that should be
  shown where the secret is.  This includes checking whether you have
  gotten the secret on that screen, if applicable.  There are 6 possible
  secrets: a pushable rock ($E5), a tree in the forest with a door under
  it ($E6), a round bush with stairs under it ($E7), a well ($E8), a
  statue ($E9), and a statue with stairs under it ($EA).

  There can be only one secret per screen.  If you were to put more than
  one secret on a screen, only the last one (the bottommost square of
  the rightmost column that contains a secret) would be marked as the
  row and column that a secret is at (and therefore would be the only
  secret you could use by walking into it), and all the secrets on the
  screen would share the same state of whether they were found or not,
  since there is only one bit per overworld screen devoted to storing
  that state.

  Underworld Square Table          91928          8               1



  3.2.  Underworld Data

  Underworld data consists of 768 bytes for a group of levels.  There
  are 4 data blocks, one for levels 1-6 and 7-9 on each quest.  Each
  data block contains maps and other information (not all deciphered
  yet).  There is one Underworld Map in each data block:  All levels in
  that block share a map.  The map is 384 bytes from the start of the
  data, and is 128 bytes long.  This is the Underworld Map referred to
  in the next section.


  3.3.  Underworld Levels

  An underworld level is 8 by 8 screens, for up to 64 map screens per
  level.  The screen number is used as an index into the Underworld Map
  for a particular level.  Bits 0-5 of each byte in an underworld map
  are an index into the underworld screen table.


  3.4.  The Underworld Screen Table

  There are 64 unique underworld screens for ALL of the underworld.
  Each byte in a map for an underworld level refers to one of these 64
  possible screens in the underworld screen table.  The Underworld
  Screen Table is a table with 64 entries.  Each entry takes up 12
  bytes, one for each column.


  3.5.  Underworld Screens

  Every underworld screen has 12 columns.  Each column byte has two
  parts: the high nibble is used to select a column table from the
  column directory, and the low nibble is used to select a column from
  that column table.


  3.6.  Underworld Columns

  There are 10 underworld column tables (there could be up to 16, but
  the last 6 are unused).  Each column table can have up to 16 columns.
  The columns in a column table are all run together like in the
  overworld column tables, with the beginning of individual columns
  marked by bit 7 being set.
  Each column has 7 squares in it.  Unlike the overworld, where columns
  can be from 6 to 11 bytes, underworld columns can be from 1 to 7
  bytes.  Bits 0-2 are a square number (index into the Underworld Square
  Table).  Bit 3 seems to be unused.  Bits 4-6 are a number from 0 to 6
  indicating how many additional times to repeat this square.  0 means
  draw the square once, 1 means draw it twice, and so on.  If the number
  was 7 it would not mean to draw the square 8 times, since a column has
  only 7 squares, the column would stop after the 7th square.


  3.7.  Underworld Squares

  Since the square number is 3 bits, there are 8 possible squares in the
  underworld.  There is no secondary square table.  The square code is
  looked up in the single square table which is 8 bytes long.  If the
  code is less than 112 or greater than 242, it is a tile pattern to
  draw for all 4 tiles in the square.  Otherwise the code is the first
  in a sequence of 4 tile numbers (from Pattern Table 1) that form the
  upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right tiles in the
  square.

  All squares in a 12x7 underworld screen are always in the same place
  every time you enter the screen.  There are no secrets like in the
  overworld that cause screens to look different (trees become stairs,
  rocks become doors, etc) when you enter them.


  3.8.  Underworld Doors

  3.8.1.  Finding Door Information

  In each data block (see section "Underworld Data"), there are two
  tables relevant to doors.  One table contains information about West
  and East doors, the other has information about North and South doors.
  Each door table is 128 bytes long.  The N/S door table is at the very
  beginning of the data block.  The W/E door table is immediately after
  it (128 bytes from the start of the data block).  The screen number
  from 0 to 127 is an index to a particular entry in a door table.

  Each door in each screen has a 3-bit door code.  The door code for the
  north door is in bits 5-7 of the N/S door table, with bits 2-4 for the
  south door.  Bits 5-7 of the W/E door table are for the West door, and
  bits 2-4 are for the East door.  I don't know what bits 0 or 1 are for
  in any of these tables.


  3.8.2.  Door Codes


  Code    Meaning
  --------------------
  0       Open door
  1       ?
  2       ?
  3       ?
  4       Bombable
  5       Key Door
  6       Key Door
  7       Shutter Door



  Codes 1, 2, and 3 cause a regular wall to be drawn every time the
  screen is entered.  I suspect one of these is the regular wall and one
  is the walk-through wall, and the other is unknown (possibly a
  duplicate of one of the others), but I don't know which of the 3 codes
  are which.  Please e-mail me when you find out by modifying door
  codes.

  There are two different kinds of key doors that look exactly alike but
  have a different code for some reason (codes 5 and 6).

  Level information is loaded for each level 0-9 (with 0 being the
  overworld).  The Level Info Directory contains the addresses of level
  information blocks for each level; I have calculated their offsets
  here for your convenience.  Much of the level information blocks is
  not decoded yet.


  4.1.2.  Starting Locations

  The starting location for a level is a screen number, found at byte 47
  from the start of the level information block for that level.
